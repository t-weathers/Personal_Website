      Recent Article written by me about effects of Dicamba:
      <p align:"center" id = "newsparagraph1">
        This article is about the effects of Dicamba, a new strong weed-killer manufactured by Monsanto, and the lack of control over where it spreads. With the past most common weed-killer, Glysophate also known commonly as Round-Up, recently becoming insignificant due to a weed known as pig-weed developing a resistance to Round-Up (Charles [1], 2017). One farmer who hadn’t switched to new genetically modified Dicamba resistant plants, found that their crops were dying from poisoning to Dicamba, when the farmer hadn’t sprayed it themselves (Charles [1], 2017). This is because one common problem found with Dicamba is that it can quickly evaporate before settling into the plants, and therefore spread in an airborne manner to other farms that may not have been genetically modified for Dicamba resistance (Charles [1], 2017). This article poses a very important question: should Dicamba be allowed to be used publically if there are known effects that spread to un-wanting nearby farmers, which are killing their crops? This question and this article is very valuable in conversation in today’s world because this is a problem that is reaching a state and almost national judicial stage to find who is at fault and if laws are being broken by users of Dicamba. On one hand, it makes sense that the users of Dicamba shouldn’t be at fault because they are not intentionally spreading the Dicamba to other people’s land, but on the contrary, the person whose farms are damaged shouldn’t be able to get their land destroyed with no consequences for the cause of the damage. The source of this article is from the National Public Radio station or NPR. NPR is a very reliable and unbiased source of information. This article was written specifically by Dan Charles, who is an NPR reporter, but not a scientist or environmental researcher himself. This could lead us to question the strength of his argument, and the validity of his opinion. In another article I researched about the idea of “Dicamba Drift”, they found that there has actually been a reported death linked to Dicamba, and it has hurt thousands of acres of land since the release of the Monsanto resistant soy seed that was released (Nosowitz, 2017).
  	     In the in-class discussion that we had, I was in a group with Habib Algousif and Ibrahim Mahmoud, where we were prompted to discuss if the government should restrict the use of Dicamba in mass quantities. My personal opinion was very straightforward, and wavered very little in this discussion. I had heard a little bit about Dicamba before this lecture so I most likely carried a bias into the discussion. I believe that Dicamba needs to be banned for mass use until it can be adjusted so that It doesn’t evaporate into the air and drift to neighboring farms unintentionally. I think that in the courts in the upcoming trials about the use of Dicamba, will end up finding that the people spraying Dicamba were not intentionally at fault, and that no specific person was at fault here. In my group, we were almost unanimously in agreement that this cannot keep going on this way, where farmers who consciously made the choice to not use Monsanto’s resistant soy, are now being forced to consider it or potentially lose their crops, and this is unfair to the farmer. We all agreed that currently we cannot allow Dicamba to be used as it is, because it cannot be contained and there are a lot of problems with public health regarding the weed-killer as well. In another article, I found that Arkansas actually banned the use of Dicamba for the whole growing season this last year, in attempts to eliminate the damage that could not be effectively controlled in the growing season hot temperatures (Charles [2], 2017).  This ruling is marked by a lot of controversy, because Monsanto thinks that the ruling is unfair because they claim that the product was being misused and it is not their fault that the Dicamba is spreading to neighboring farms.
